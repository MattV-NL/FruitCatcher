# FruitCatcher

## Added Features
Since creating the environment for this game I have added a few features.
There are now power ups in the game! A "one up" power up will give the player an extra life. The "dash" power up will speed up the players basket makingit easier to get to those pesky fruit on the far side of the screen. And finaly there is a "slow down" power up which will slow the fruit dropping speed allowing the player more time to get in the best position possible.

I also changed the information tab so that the player is prompted with the information at the beginning and then the modal will be closed. The information can be opened then again at any time by clicking the question mark icon by the rest of the buttons.

This is a project I created to display my abilities to create a simple game from scratch using only HMTL, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

In this game the objective is to catch the falling fruit on the screen in the basket and avoid any bombs you see falling as well.

Let me know what you think of the game by reaching out to me on twitter @mattvey16

I'm always looking for ways to improve not only this project but my skills and knowledge of programming!

# Enjoy!
