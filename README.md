# FruitCatcher

This is a project I created to display my abilities to create a simple game from scratch using only HMTL, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

In this game the objective is to catch the falling fruit on the screen in the basket and avoid any bombs you see falling as well.

Let me know what you think of the game by reaching out to me on twitter @mattvey16

I'm always looking for ways to improve not only this project but my skills and knowledge fro programming!

# Enjoy!
