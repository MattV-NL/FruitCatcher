# FruitCatcher
This is a project I completed to create a simple game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was a great way to learn some simply but powerful concepts as a person who is learning to code.

## Funcitonality
The app starts off by showing the user the controls for the game. Once the user is satisfied with the information they can close this modal and see the full screen. The user then simply presses the start button to begin the game. The game has various fruits falling along the screen and the objective is to get the fruits in the basket, but watch out for bombs!
The lives control the duration of the game and the game time is tracked by the timer above the play area. The score is also tracked here as well.
There are enhancements in the game as well as the fruits and bombs. One slows the drop speed of the fruits and bombs. Another adds a life to the players lives. Finally, one increases the speed of the players basket

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to come up with an idea for a game that is attractive to the eye, fun to play, but also challenging to create from scratch. I feel I accomplished all of these items with this project.

## Deployment
The game is deployed with GitHub Pages and you can find it here https://mattv-nl.github.io/FruitCatcher/

I hope you enjoy!
